# APN_Flow_Liu_PRL_2025
Data Repository for MD simulation study of associative polymer networks in extensional flow by Liu &amp; O'Connor.

This repository contains the scripts and data necessary for analyzing associative polymer networks (APNs) simulations and generating plots for the associated manuscript.

### Repository Structure

Analysis_Plots.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that provides a guided analysis workflow, including data processing and visualization.

data/: A directory containing the processed data files required for generating plots. Note: Raw simulation data files are not included due to space constraints.

example_script/: A directory including example LAMMPS input scripts and data files for simulating APNs with 18kT stickers under both equilibrium NVT and uniaxial extensional flow conditions. For details regarding polymer chain architecture and simulation methodology, please refer to the method in our paper.

### LAMMPS Version and Required Packages

This analysis is based on LAMMPS version lammps-29Sep2021. The following LAMMPS packages are required:

MOLECULE

MANYBODY

UEF

UEFEX

NETCDF

Additionally, we customize the MANYBODY package with modified pair_tersoff .cpp and .h files that allow binary coordination and bond swapping of stickers. These files are uploaded in this repository in `customized_teroff_lammps`. We utilize the version for dissociative-type hydrogen-bonding-like exchange kinetics with half barrier in `tersoff_lammps_file_with_half_barrier` to conduct our APNs simulations.

### Requirements

The scripts require the following Python packages:

numpy

matplotlib

jupyter

Install dependencies using:

pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter

### Usage Guide

Prepare Data: Ensure the processed data files are placed inside the data/ folder.

Run the Notebook: Open and execute Analysis_Plots.ipynb to generate the figures for the manuscript.

### Notes

The Jupyter notebook provides step-by-step guidance on the analysis process.

Modify paths in the notebook if necessary to match your directory structure.
